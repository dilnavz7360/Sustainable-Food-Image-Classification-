# Sustainable-Food-Image-Classification-

Problem Statement:

Manual classification of food items for sustainability assessment or waste monitoring is inefficient and prone to human error. There is a need for an automated system that can accurately classify food images into categories and indicate their environmental impact.
Hence, this project aims to build a deep learning-based food image classifier to identify food categories and promote sustainable food awareness.
